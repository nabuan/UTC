# UTC
----Universal Tweezers Controller----
A LabWindows based data acquisition program for optical tweezers. The programs drives an npoint nanopositioner using pulse frequency modulation,
digitally acquire piezo position using a differential quadrature encoder, while  reading (NI DAQMX - AI) the deflections of two counter propogating lasers
registerend in seperate quadrant PIN photdiodes (QP). In addition the program utlizies multi-threading capabilities to drive two cameras to
acquire simultaneous image information.
